# todo_py
A simple Python application to add, update, and delete tasks.

Lessons Learned:
Had a bit of a learning curve at the beginning, but make sense once I get how frames work
This mini-project was messy in architecture. 
Maybe I revist and redo the entire architecture.

I can see the benefits of tkinter being used in local environment vs HTML, CSS, JS on web.
Kind of like an exe vs web.
Maybe i play with tkinter more in the future
